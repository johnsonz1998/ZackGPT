Or update from requirements.txt:

```

## Usage

### Automatic Detection

ZackGPT automatically detects when web search is needed based on your questions:

- **Current events**: "What's happening in the news today?"
- **Real-time data**: "What's the weather like?", "Bitcoin price"
- **Recent information**: "Latest updates on AI"
- **Specific searches**: "Search for Python tutorials"

### Explicit Search Commands

You can also explicitly request web searches:

- "Search for [topic]"
- "Look up [information]"
- "Find information about [subject]"
- "What is [recent topic]"

### Example Queries

```
‚ùØ What's the latest news about AI?
‚ùØ Search for Python web scraping tutorials
‚ùØ What's the weather like in New York today?
‚ùØ Who won the latest sports championship?
‚ùØ Look up the current Bitcoin price
‚ùØ Tell me about recent developments in quantum computing
```

## Search Behavior

### Smart Detection Triggers

The system looks for these patterns to decide when to search:

1. **Time indicators**: today, now, current, latest, recent
2. **News keywords**: news, happening, events, updates
3. **Search triggers**: search for, look up, tell me about
4. **Real-time data**: weather, stocks, cryptocurrency, scores
5. **Current year references**: 2024, 2023, etc.

### Search Process

1. **Query extraction** - Extracts the actual search terms from your question
2. **Multi-engine search** - Tries search engines in order of preference
3. **Result formatting** - Formats results for AI consumption
4. **Integration** - Adds search results to the AI's context
5. **Response generation** - AI provides comprehensive answer with current data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Web search is disabled"**
   - Check that `WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED=true` in your `.env` file
   - Restart the application after changing environment variables

2. **"No search results found"**
   - Verify your API keys are correct
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try a different search query

3. **API key errors**
   - Make sure API keys are active and have remaining quota
   - Check that the keys are properly formatted in `.env`

4. **Import errors**
   - Install missing dependencies: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml`
   - Update requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see detailed search information:

```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

This will show:
- Search query extraction
- Which search engines are tried
- Search results and formatting
- Integration with AI responses
